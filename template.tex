\begin{abstract}
We report on a study conducted to determine the feasibility and performance of distributed processing of language data, using Support Vector Machines methods. This represents the first large-scale use of the CODE-RADE platform developed to provide continuous delivery of research applications in a distributed environment. The study was conducted using pre-prepared sets of data and a support-vector machine library.

\section{Introduction}
\label{intro}
% General use case - how are we using SVM for language? What is being studied ?
We need to compute some things about human language. One of the things we need to do is classification. This can be done with several kinds of tools - this tool, that tool, and support vector machines. One of the libraries which we could use to do this is \texttt{libsvm} \cite{Chang2011LIBSVMMachines}.

% Basic research question : is it feasible to conduct this kind of study on a distributed computing environment ? 
This kind of study is in principle well-suited to a distributed computing environment, since it is possible to decouple the various computational steps
